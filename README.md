# Code UI Challenge #

This is a UI project developed for a test recruitment



***

To run the setup:
```
git clone https://github.com/glauber-silva/ui-challenge
npm install
npm start (or npm run build)
```

To run tests:
```
npm test
```

Javascript Libraries used:

- Express
- React ( react, reac-dom, react-router, react-redux, redux, axios, react-bootstrap, react-google-maps )
- Webpack
- Npm scripts

This project does not fully contemplate automated testing. There is the command to run the tests and Mocha installed for that, but only a few tests have been written.

In this project I tried 3 different forms of task runners. As it was not advisable to use any type of scaffold, I was testing the possibilities, in the end I opted for webpack + npm script. WebPack is a very complete tool and with npm scripts it allows a smaller number of lines of code.
